# Unity Code MCP

## Description
Unity Code MCP is a coding focused Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to write Unity code autonomously.

## üéØ Why Unity Code MCP?

Unity Code MCP is a high-performance, coding-focused MCP server built in Rust. It handles Unity's compilation cycles gracefully while providing only the essential tools needed for autonomous code development: compilation feedback and test execution.

This MCP server enables AI agents to develop Unity code autonomously with exceptional speed and reliability - write code, compile, fix compile errors, test, fix bugs, repeat, just like how a human would.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ü§ñ Coding-Optimized**: Streamlined tools designed for efficient AI agent coding workflows
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Built in Rust for exceptional speed, minimal memory usage, and lightning-fast response times
- **üéØ Efficient Communication**: Minimal token usage with essential operations, only returns relevant information
- **üß™ Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test execution and reporting capabilities
- **üì¶ Self-Contained**: Single binary with no runtime dependencies (no Node.js, Python, or .NET required)

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Server Tools

Unity Code MCP provides 2 tools for autonomous code development:

### 1. **Asset Database Refresh**
- Triggers Unity compilation and asset processing
- Returns compile errors and other non compile warning and errors **only include the logs during the refresh**
- Handles domain reload gracefully

### 2. **Test Execution**
- Runs Unity tests with comprehensive reporting
- Provides detailed stack traces and logs for failures
- Supports both EditMode and PlayMode tests

## üöÄ Autonomous AI agent workflow example

Once configured, AI agents can develop Unity code completely autonomously:

```
User: "Create a player controller that moves with WASD keys and has jump functionality. Make sure it's fully tested."

AI: I'll create a complete player controller with movement and jumping, then write comprehensive tests.

1. [AI writes PlayerController.cs with movement logic]
2. [AI calls: refresh_asset_database]
   ‚Üí Result: "Compilation failed: CS0246: The type or namespace name 'Rigidbody' could not be found"
3. [AI fixes the missing using UnityEngine; statement]
4. [AI calls: refresh_asset_database]
   ‚Üí Result: "Compilation successful, no errors"
5. [AI writes PlayerControllerTests.cs with movement and jump tests]
6. [AI calls: run_tests]
   ‚Üí Result: "5 tests passed, 2 tests failed: NullReferenceException in Jump_ShouldApplyUpwardForce, ArgumentException in Move_WithInvalidInput"
7. [AI analyzes failures and fixes null reference and input validation bugs]
8. [AI calls: refresh_asset_database]
   ‚Üí Result: "Compilation successful, no errors"
9. [AI calls: run_tests]
   ‚Üí Result: "All 7 tests passed successfully"

AI: ‚úÖ Complete! Created a fully functional PlayerController with WASD movement, jump mechanics, and comprehensive test coverage. All tests are passing.
```

This demonstrates true autonomous development - from user request to fully tested, working Unity code without any human intervention.

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Unity 6.0 or higher
- Rust toolchain (for building from source)
- CMake and a C compiler (required for building dependencies)

### Step 1: Install Unity Package
Install the [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://github.com/hackerzhuli/com.hackerzhuli.code) package in your Unity project.

### Step 2: Get the Binary
**Option A: Download Release** (Recommended) (Windows Only)
- Download the latest binary from the Releases page

**Option B: Build from Source**
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Step 3: Configure Your AI Assistant
Add the MCP server to your AI assistant configuration:

**For Claude Desktop/Cursor/Trae:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity-code": {
      "command": "/path/to/unity-code-mcp",
      "env": {
        "UNITY_PROJECT_PATH": "/path/to/your/unity/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For VS Code with MCP Extension:**
```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "unity-code": {
      "command": "/path/to/unity-code-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "UNITY_PROJECT_PATH": "/path/to/your/unity/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Use absolute paths for both the binary and Unity project directory.

## Platform support
The code is cross platform, but I can't build or test for other platforms, because I only use Windows. If there are platform specific bugs, you have to fix them yourself.

## üß™ Development & Testing

### Running Tests
To run the test suite:

1. **Start Unity Editor** with the embedded test project:
   ```bash
   # Open Unity Editor and load the project at:
   # ./UnityProject
   ```

2. **Run tests** (single-threaded to avoid Unity conflicts):
   ```bash
   cargo test -- --test-threads=1
   ```

> **Note**: Tests require a running Unity Editor instance with the embedded project loaded. Tests may take 30-60 seconds to complete due to Unity Editor interactions.

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: Required for building `aws-lc-rs` dependency
  - Windows: MSVC (Visual Studio Build Tools)
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - Linux: GCC (`sudo apt-get install build-essential` on Ubuntu/Debian)
- **CMake**: Required for building the `aws-lc-rs` dependency
  - Windows: Follow the [official guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/requirements/windows.html)
  - macOS: `brew install cmake`
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install cmake` (Ubuntu/Debian)

#### Build Commands
```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (recommended for production)
cargo build --release
```
