# Unity Code MCP Server

> A robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to seamlessly interact with Unity Editor, surviving domain reloads and compilation cycles.

## üéØ Why Unity Code MCP?

**The Problem**: Existing Unity MCP servers fail when Unity is compiling or performing domain reloads, causing AI tool calls to break and interrupting development workflows.

**The Solution**: Unity Code MCP is specifically designed to handle Unity's compilation cycles gracefully, ensuring reliable AI-Unity communication even during asset database refreshes and domain reloads.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîÑ Compilation-Resilient**: Survives Unity domain reloads and compilation cycles
- **ü§ñ AI-Optimized**: Streamlined tools designed for efficient AI agent workflows
- **‚ö° Performance-Focused**: Minimal token usage with targeted, essential operations
- **üß™ Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test execution and reporting capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Capabilities

Unity Code MCP provides two essential tools that enable AI agents to work autonomously:

### 1. **Asset Database Refresh**
- Triggers Unity compilation and asset processing
- Returns detailed compilation errors and warnings
- Handles domain reload scenarios gracefully

### 2. **Test Execution**
- Runs Unity tests with comprehensive reporting
- Provides detailed logs and stack traces for failures
- Supports both EditMode and PlayMode tests

### Why Only Two Tools?

This focused approach eliminates token waste by providing only the essential information AI agents need:
- **Compilation feedback** for code correctness
- **Test results** for functionality validation

This enables AI agents to maintain a productive development loop: *write ‚Üí compile ‚Üí fix errors ‚Üí test ‚Üí fix bugs ‚Üí repeat*.

## üöÄ Quick Start Example

Once configured, AI assistants can interact with Unity like this:

```
AI: I'll create a new player controller script and test it.

1. [AI writes PlayerController.cs]
2. [AI calls: refresh_asset_database]
   ‚Üí Result: "Compilation successful, no errors"
3. [AI writes PlayerControllerTests.cs]
4. [AI calls: run_tests]
   ‚Üí Result: "3 tests passed, 1 test failed: NullReferenceException in MovePlayer_ShouldUpdatePosition"
5. [AI fixes the bug and repeats until all tests pass]
```

This seamless workflow allows AI assistants to develop Unity code autonomously, handling compilation and testing without human intervention.

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Unity 6.0 or higher
- Rust toolchain (for building from source)
- CMake (required for building dependencies)

### Step 1: Install Unity Package
Install the [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://github.com/hackerzhuli/com.hackerzhuli.code) package in your Unity project.

### Step 2: Get the Binary
**Option A: Download Release** (Recommended)
- Download the latest binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/unity-code-mcp/releases) page

**Option B: Build from Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/unity-code-mcp.git
cd unity-code-mcp
cargo build --release
```

### Step 3: Configure Your AI Assistant
Add the MCP server to your AI assistant configuration:

**For Claude Desktop:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity-code": {
      "command": "/path/to/unity-code-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "UNITY_PROJECT_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/unity/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For VS Code with MCP Extension:**
```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "unity-code": {
      "command": "/path/to/unity-code-mcp-server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "UNITY_PROJECT_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/unity/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Use absolute paths for both the binary and Unity project directory.

## üß™ Development & Testing

### Running Tests
To run the test suite:

1. **Start Unity Editor** with the embedded test project:
   ```bash
   # Open Unity Editor and load the project at:
   # ./UnityProject
   ```

2. **Run tests** (single-threaded to avoid Unity conflicts):
   ```bash
   cargo test -- --test-threads=1
   ```

> **Note**: Tests require a running Unity Editor instance with the embedded project loaded. Tests may take 30-60 seconds to complete due to Unity Editor interactions.

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites
- **CMake**: Required for building the `aws-lc-rs` dependency
  - Windows: Follow the [official guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/requirements/windows.html)
  - macOS: `brew install cmake`
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install cmake` (Ubuntu/Debian)

#### Build Commands
```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (recommended for production)
cargo build --release

# Run with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```
