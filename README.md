# Unity Code MCP Server

> A **coding-focused** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to write Unity code autonomously, surviving domain reloads and compilation cycles.

## üéØ Why Unity Code MCP?

Unity Code MCP is laser-focused on what AI agents do best - **writing code**. It's specifically designed to handle Unity's compilation cycles gracefully while providing only the essential tools needed for autonomous code development: compilation feedback and test execution.

Other Unity MCP servers typically fail when Unity is compiling or performing domain reloads, causing AI tool calls to report an error and AI agents confused about what is going on.

Example, with a typical Unity MCP server, when Unity Editor is compiling, and AI make a tool call to run tests. The tool fails because of disconnection.

Not Unity Code MCP! AI agent can make a tool call, whether to refresh asset database or run tests, while Unity is compiling. And the tool call with wait for the compilation to finish and then refresh asset database or run tests. 

**üéØ Coding-First Philosophy**: Unlike other Unity MCP servers, we deliberately exclude scene editing, package management, and asset manipulation. This focused approach allow us to ensure high quality and high performance implementation because there is less code to maintain. This also reduces your token usage because AI has less instructions to read about the tools.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîÑ Compilation-Resilient**: Survives Unity domain reloads and compilation cycles
- **ü§ñ AI-Optimized**: Streamlined tools designed for efficient AI agent coding workflows
- **‚ö° Performance-Focused**: Minimal token usage with targeted, essential operations
- **üß™ Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test execution and reporting capabilities
- **üì¶ Self-Contained**: Single binary with no runtime dependencies (no Node.js, Python, or .NET required)
- **üöÄ High Performance**: Built in Rust for speed and minimal resource usage

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Capabilities

Unity Code MCP provides **exactly two tools** designed for autonomous code development:

### 1. **Asset Database Refresh**
- Triggers Unity compilation and asset processing
- Returns only compilation errors and nothing else
- Handles domain reload scenarios gracefully
- Essential for validating code correctness

### 2. **Test Execution**
- Runs Unity tests with comprehensive reporting
- Provides stack traces for failures
- Provides logs for logs captured in a test (this will help AI agents to debug the test by inserting `Debug.Log` statements)
- Supports both EditMode and PlayMode tests

### Why Only Two Tools?

This laser-focused approach maximizes AI efficiency by:
- **Eliminating token waste** on non-coding operations
- **Concentrating on AI strengths** - writing code
- **Providing only essential feedback** for the code development loop
- **Reducing complexity** and potential failure points

Result: AI agents maintain a highly productive development loop: *write ‚Üí compile ‚Üí fix errors ‚Üí test ‚Üí fix bugs ‚Üí repeat*.

AI agents can't read other logs, only current compilation errors from Asset Database Refresh tool call, this means less waste of tool calls and less token usage, give AI only what is useful.

## üöÄ Quick Start Example

Once configured, AI assistants can interact with Unity like this:

```
AI: I'll create a new player controller script and test it.

1. [AI writes PlayerController.cs]
2. [AI calls: refresh_asset_database]
   ‚Üí Result: "Compilation successful, no errors"
3. [AI writes PlayerControllerTests.cs]
4. [AI calls: run_tests]
   ‚Üí Result: "3 tests passed, 1 test failed: NullReferenceException in MovePlayer_ShouldUpdatePosition"
5. [AI fixes the bug and repeats until all tests pass]
```

This seamless workflow allows AI assistants to develop Unity code autonomously, handling compilation and testing without human intervention.

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Unity 6.0 or higher
- Rust toolchain (for building from source)
- CMake (required for building dependencies)

### Step 1: Install Unity Package
Install the [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://github.com/hackerzhuli/com.hackerzhuli.code) package in your Unity project.

### Step 2: Get the Binary
**Option A: Download Release** (Recommended)
- Download the latest binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/unity-code-mcp/releases) page

**Option B: Build from Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/unity-code-mcp.git
cd unity-code-mcp
cargo build --release
```

### Step 3: Configure Your AI Assistant
Add the MCP server to your AI assistant configuration:

**For Claude Desktop/Cursor/Trae:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity-code": {
      "command": "/path/to/unity-code-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "UNITY_PROJECT_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/unity/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For VS Code with MCP Extension:**
```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "unity-code": {
      "command": "/path/to/unity-code-mcp-server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "UNITY_PROJECT_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/your/unity/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important**: Use absolute paths for both the binary and Unity project directory.

## üß™ Development & Testing

### Running Tests
To run the test suite:

1. **Start Unity Editor** with the embedded test project:
   ```bash
   # Open Unity Editor and load the project at:
   # ./UnityProject
   ```

2. **Run tests** (single-threaded to avoid Unity conflicts):
   ```bash
   cargo test -- --test-threads=1
   ```

> **Note**: Tests require a running Unity Editor instance with the embedded project loaded. Tests may take 30-60 seconds to complete due to Unity Editor interactions.

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: Required for building `aws-lc-rs` dependency
  - Windows: MSVC (Visual Studio Build Tools)
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - Linux: GCC (`sudo apt-get install build-essential` on Ubuntu/Debian)
- **CMake**: Required for building the `aws-lc-rs` dependency
  - Windows: Follow the [official guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/requirements/windows.html)
  - macOS: `brew install cmake`
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install cmake` (Ubuntu/Debian)

#### Build Commands
```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (recommended for production)
cargo build --release
```
