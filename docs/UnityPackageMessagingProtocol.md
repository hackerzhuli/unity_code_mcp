# Visual Studio Code Editor Messaging Protocol

This document describes the UDP-based messaging protocol used by Visual Studio Code Editor package for communication between Unity Editor and Visual Studio Code.

The name of this package is `com.hackerzhuli.code`. The name of the official package this is forked from is `com.unity.ide.visualstudio`. The messaging protocol is modified for better development experience with Visual Studio Code.

## Overview

The protocol uses UDP as the primary transport with automatic fallback to TCP for large messages. The communication is bidirectional, allowing both Unity and Visual Studio Code to send messages to each other.

## Network Configuration

### Port Calculation
- **Messaging Port**: `58000 + (ProcessId % 1000)`
- **Protocol**: UDP (primary), TCP (fallback for large messages)
- **Address**: Binds to `IPAddress.Any` (0.0.0.0)

### Client Timeout Configuration
- **Timeout Period**: Clients are removed after **4 seconds** of inactivity
- **Heartbeat Requirement**: Clients must send messages at least once within the timeout period to stay registered

## Message Format

Messages are serialized in binary format using little-endian encoding:

```
[4 bytes] Message Type (int32)
[4 bytes] String Length (int32)
[N bytes] String Value (UTF-8 encoded)
```

### Message Structure
- **Type**: 32-bit integer representing the MessageType enum value
- **Value**: UTF-8 encoded string with length prefix
- **Origin**: Set by receiver to identify sender's endpoint

### Serialization Details
- **Integer Encoding**: Little-endian 32-bit integers
- **String Encoding**: UTF-8 with 32-bit length prefix
- **Empty Strings**: Represented as length 0 followed by no data
- **Null Strings**: Treated as empty strings

### Value Format Details

Detailed value formats for some of the types:

- **Empty Requests**: `Ping`, `Pong`, `None` always use empty string values
- **Version**: 
  - Request: Empty string
  - Response: Package version string (e.g., "2.0.17")
- **ProjectPath**: 
  - Request: Empty string  
  - Response: Full path to Unity project directory
- **PackageName**: 
  - Request: Empty string
  - Response: Package name string (e.g., "com.hackerzhuli.code")
- **Online**: Empty string - sent when this package comes online after domain reload or editor startup
- **Offline**: Empty string - sent when this package goes offline before domain reload or editor shutdown
- **IsPlaying**: 
  - Value: "true" when Unity is in play mode, "false" when in edit mode
  - Sent automatically when play mode state changes (entering/exiting play mode)
  - Sent to new clients when they connect or when this package comes online
- **Tcp**: Internal format `"<port>:<length>"` (eg. "1234:1024") where port is the TCP listener port and length is the expected message size

- **Test Messages**: Value format depends on Unity's test runner implementation and may contain JSON or structured data

#### RetrieveTestList (Value: 23)
- **Format**: Test mode string ("EditMode" or "PlayMode")
- **Example**: `"EditMode"`
- **Description**: Requests the list of available tests for the specified test mode

#### ExecuteTests (Value: 24)
- **Format**: Supports multiple formats:
  - `TestMode` - Execute all tests in the specified mode
  - `TestMode:AssemblyName.dll` - Execute all tests in the specified assembly
  - `TestMode:FullTestName` - Execute a specific test by its full name
- **Examples**: 
  - `"EditMode"` - Run all edit mode tests
  - `"PlayMode:MyTests.dll"` - Run all tests in MyTests assembly
  - `"EditMode:MyNamespace.MyTestClass"` - Run all tests in MyTestClass
- **Description**: Executes tests based on the specified filter. The filter can target all tests in a mode, all tests in an assembly, or a specific test by name.

Response:
- A response that is empty is sent to the original client to confirm that the message is received and already processed.

#### TestStarted (Value: 20)
- **Format**: JSON serialized TestAdaptorContainer
- **Important**: Each message contains only top-level test adaptors with no children data. This is an optimization to avoid sending redundant hierarchy information.
- **Note**: The Source field is not populated in this message type for efficiency.
- **C# Structure**:
  
```csharp
public enum TestNodeType{
  Solution,
  Assembly,
  Namespace,
  Class,
  Method,
  /// <summary>
  /// Test case of a parameterized test method
  /// </summary>
  TestCase,
}

[Serializable]
internal class TestAdaptorContainer
{
    public TestAdaptor[] TestAdaptors; // Always contains exactly one element
}

[Serializable]
internal class TestAdaptor
{
  /// <summary>
  /// Unique identifier for the test node, persisted (as much as possible) across compiles, will not conflict accross test modes
  /// </summary>
  public string Id;

  public string Source;

  /// <summary>
  /// Number of leaf tests in this test node and its children
  /// </summary>
  public int TestCount;
}
```

#### TestFinished (Value: 21)
- **Format**: JSON serialized TestResultAdaptorContainer
- **Important**: Each message contains only top-level test results with no children data. This is an optimization to avoid sending redundant data.

}

[Serializable]
internal enum TestStatusAdaptor
{
    Passed,        // 0
    Skipped,       // 1

}
```

- **Description**: Sent when a test finishes execution. Each message contains only top-level test results without any children data, ensuring efficient and non-redundant messaging.

#### TestRunStarted (Value: 18)
- **Format**: JSON serialized TestAdaptorContainer
- **Important**: Each message contains only top-level test adaptors with no children. This is an optimization to avoid sending redundant hierarchy information.
- **Note**: The Source field is not populated in this message type for efficiency.
- **C# Structure**: Uses the same TestAdaptorContainer and TestAdaptor structures as TestStarted (see TestStarted section for complete structure)
- **Description**: Sent when a test run begins execution. Only the top-level tests are included, and the Source field is not populated.
- **Usage**: Clients can use this to prepare UI, show progress indicators, or track which tests are part of the current run.

#### ShowUsage (Value: 25)
- **Format**: JSON serialized FileUsage object
- **C# Structure**:

```csharp
[Serializable]
internal class FileUsage
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The file path to show usage for. Can be absolute or relative to project.
    /// </summary>
    public string Path;
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Optional array of GameObject names representing the hierarchy path within a scene.
    /// Used when showing usage of a specific GameObject in a Unity scene.
    /// Example: ["ParentObject", "ChildObject", "TargetObject"]
    /// </summary>
    public string[] GameObjectPath;
}
```

- **Description**: Requests Unity to show usage/location of a specific file or GameObject. Unity will focus the Project window and select the specified asset, or open a scene and select a GameObject if a hierarchy path is provided.
- **Behavior**:
  - For non-scene files: Selects and pings the asset in the Project window
  - For .unity scene files: Prompts to open the scene (single, additive, or cancel), then optionally navigates to a specific GameObject using the GameObjectPath
  - Handles both absolute and relative file paths, normalizing them to project-relative paths
- **Example**: `{"Path":"Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity","GameObjectPath":["UI","Canvas","Button"]}`

#### TestListRetrieved (Value: 22)
- **Format**: `TestMode:JsonData`
- **Structure**: `TestModeName + ":" + JSON serialized TestAdaptorContainer`
- **TestModeName**: "EditMode" or "PlayMode"
- **JsonData**: JSON serialized TestAdaptorContainer with complete test hierarchy (unlike other test messages which only contain top level test adaptors)
- **Important**: This is the only test message that contains the complete hierarchical structure with all tests and their relationships
- **Description**: Response containing the complete hierarchical test structure as JSON for the requested test mode

## Protocol Flow

### Client Registration
1. Client sends any message to this package's messaging port
2. This package registers the client's endpoint
3. This package responds appropriately based on message type
4. Client must send messages within 4 seconds to stay registered 

### Heartbeat Mechanism
- Send `Ping` message to this package
- This package responds with `Pong` message
- Clients are automatically removed after 4 seconds of inactivity 

### Online/Offline and Domain Reload
When domain reload starts(typically along with compilation), this package is disabled due to Unity's mechanism. Socket will be disposed and this package can't receive messages for a while(domain reload can take up to a minute depending on the project). The Offline message is sent right before this package's socket is disposed.

Once domain reload finishes, this package will be enabled and socket will be recreated. And previous clients will be preserved. But messages that are not handled or not received at all(when this package is offline) will not be processed. The Online message is sent right after this package's socket is recreated.

### Large Message Handling (TCP Fallback)

When a message exceeds the 8KB UDP buffer limit, the protocol automatically switches to TCP for reliable delivery of large messages.

#### Fallback Trigger
- **Condition**: Serialized message size ≥ 8192 bytes (`UdpSocket.BufferSize`)
- **Detection**: Sender checks buffer length before UDP transmission
- **Scope**: Applies to individual messages, not the entire connection

#### Detailed Process

**1. Sender (This package or Client)**:
   - Detects message size exceeds UDP buffer limit
   - Creates a temporary TCP listener on an available port (system-assigned)
   - Replaces original message with `Tcp` control message
   - Sends UDP message with `MessageType.Tcp` and value format: `"<port>:<length>"`
   - Waits for incoming TCP connection on the listener port
   - Sends the actual large message over TCP connection
   - Closes TCP connection and listener after transmission

**2. Receiver (This package or Client)**:
   - Receives `Tcp` control message via UDP
   - Validates message type is `MessageType.Tcp` (value: 17)
   - Parses message value to extract: `port` and `length`
   - Initiates TCP connection to sender's IP address on specified port
   - Allocates buffer of exact `length` for receiving data
   - Reads complete message from TCP stream (must read exactly `length` bytes)
   - Deserializes received buffer using standard message format
   - Closes TCP connection

#### Critical Implementation Notes

- **Timeout Handling**: TCP operations have 5-second timeout (`ConnectOrReadTimeoutMilliseconds`)
- **Exact Read Required**: Must read exactly `length` bytes from TCP stream
- **Connection Cleanup**: Always close TCP connections and listeners after use
- **Error Recovery**: Failed TCP operations should not crash the UDP messaging loop
- **Thread Safety**: TCP operations run on background threads, ensure proper synchronization
- **Port Availability**: TCP listener uses system-assigned ports (port 0), not fixed ports

## Implementation Notes

- Clients can be implemented in any language that supports UDP sockets and binary serialization
- The protocol is designed for localhost communication between this package and external tools
- Message serialization uses little-endian encoding for cross-platform compatibility

## Error Handling

- **Socket Exceptions**: This package will attempt to rebind on domain reload
- **Port Conflicts**: This package uses `ReuseAddress` but conflicts may still occur
- **Message Size**: Messages larger than 8KB automatically use TCP fallback
- **Client Timeout**: Clients are removed after 4 seconds of inactivity 

## Security Considerations

- **Local Communication Only**: Protocol is designed for localhost communication
- **No Authentication**: No built-in authentication mechanism
- **Process ID Based Ports**: Ports are calculated based on Unity process ID

## Limitations

- **UDP Reliability**: No guaranteed delivery (inherent UDP limitation)
- **Message Ordering**: No guaranteed order (inherent UDP limitation)
- **Buffer Size**: 8KB limit for UDP messages (larger messages use TCP)
- **Client Management**: Automatic cleanup after 4 seconds of inactivity 

## Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**: Verify Unity process ID and calculated port
2. **Port Conflicts**: Another application might be using the calculated port
3. **Client Timeout**: Send heartbeat messages regularly within 4 seconds
